# The Alchemy of Creativity, Duality, and the Human Condition

Work in Progress

## Table of Contents

## Prologue: The Mysterious Stranger Within

In the twilight of consciousness, where the known meets the unknown, there exists a figure both familiar and alien – our shadow self. This enigmatic aspect of our psyche, as Carl Jung posited, houses our deepest desires, fears, and potential. Like the Mysterious Stranger in Mark Twain's unfinished work, it whispers truths we dare not acknowledge, challenging our perceptions of reality and morality.

"I am not human. I am a cosmic force, a force of nature. I am the universe's shadow, cast upon the canvas of mortality," Twain's Satan declares, echoing the untamed power of our unconscious mind. This shadow, when left unexpressed, can become the very Satan that torments us – a mad, cruel god of our own making.

But what if we could harness this force? What if the shadow, instead of being our nemesis, became our muse?

## The Alchemy of Creation: Pouring One's Heart and Soul

Art, in its myriad forms, serves as the alchemical crucible where the lead of our shadow self can be transmuted into the gold of expression. This process is not for the faint of heart; it demands that we pour our entire being – light and dark, conscious and unconscious – into the creative act.

Consider the intricate lore-building of "Elden Ring," a game that has stolen the hearts of millions (myself included). Its creator, Hidetaka Miyazaki, in collaboration with George R.R. Martin, crafted a universe where the fractures of reality mirror the broken psyches of its inhabitants. The Erdtree, a symbol of divine order, casts a shadow across a land teeming with horrid secret histories and wrathful cursed creatures.

In this world, everything reveolves around its god-queen Marika and (spoiler-alert!) her alter-ego Radagon – a literal split self that embodies the Jungian concept of the anima and animus. Their story is a microcosm of the game's larger themes: duality, fractured identities, and the quest for wholeness in a broken world.

## The Culinary Arts: A Feast for the Shadow

But let us step away from the grandiose for a moment and consider a more humble, yet no less profound, form of artistic expression: cooking. In the delightful manga and anime series "Delicious in Dungeon," we meet Senshi, a dwarf whose culinary creations border on the magical. His dishes, concocted from monster parts and dungeon flora, are more than mere sustenance – they're a celebration of life's ability to find beauty and nourishment in the most unexpected places.

Senshi's cooking, much like his elven squadmate Marcille's magic, represents the transformative power of self-expression. It takes the monstrous, the feared, the parts of the dungeon ecosystem that others would discard, and turns them into something not just edible, but delectable. Is this not a perfect metaphor for how we might approach our own shadow selves?

## Forging the Self: The Blacksmith's Tale

Speaking of transformation, let's turn our attention to another form of creation: the art of the blacksmith. In the stunning animated series "Blue Eye Samurai," we follow Mizu, a mixed-race swordsmith in Edo-period Japan. Her journey is one of both creation and destruction – she forges exquisite blades, each a work of art, but with the explicit purpose of dealing death.

This duality – the ability to create beauty that's ultimately used for violence – mirrors our own internal struggles. How often do we find that our greatest strengths, when misapplied or left unchecked, become our most destructive traits? Mizu's story reminds us that the shadow is not inherently evil; it's a source of power that, like a sword, can protect or destroy depending on how it's wielded.

## The Dance of Shadows: Embracing the Yin and Yang

The concept of yin and yang, central to Chinese philosophy, offers us a framework for understanding this interplay of light and dark, creation and destruction. In the "Shadow Dance," a book that delves into the depths of Jungian psychology, we're invited to see our shadow not as something to be vanquished, but as an essential part of our wholeness.

For the introvert, especially, the shadow often finds its purest expression through art. The quiet person who suddenly bursts into song, the shy painter whose canvases scream with color – these are examples of the shadow finding its voice through creative channels.

But what happens when we fail to provide an outlet for this shadow energy? The consequences can be dire. As the Daemon in Philip Pullman's "His Dark Materials" series warns, "A human being with no shadow of their own is a human being with no soul." The unexpressed shadow doesn't simply disappear; it festers, growing more potent and potentially destructive over time.

We see this theme of repressed darkness manifesting in the Dark Souls series, where the concept of the "Dark Soul" is central to the narrative. In Dark Souls and its sequels, the player encounters characters and environments that have been consumed by the encroaching shadows, not necessarily out of cruelty or moral decay, but from an inability to confront the full breadth of the human experience.

## Painting in the Dark: The Inky Void of the Soul

Take, for example, the Painted World of Ariamis in Dark Souls. This secluded realm was created by the artist Priscilla, who sought to contain the repressed desires, fears, and traumas of discarded beings - a metaphor for the shadow aspects of the psyche that we often push aside. As the player delves into this twisted, yet hauntingly beautiful world, they discover that the inhabitants have been overwhelmed by the very human feelings they were meant to embody. The paintings themselves have become portals to these unresolved emotions, reflecting Priscilla's own struggle to give voice to the full spectrum of the human condition.

Similarly, in the Ashes of Ariandel DLC for Dark Souls 3, we meet the nameless painter, a young woman tasked with creating a new world from the ashes of the old. Like Priscilla, she wrestles with harnessing the power of the repressed, the unconscious - the "dark" that is inherent to the human experience. Characters like Sister Friede, consumed by her own grief and guilt, or Gael, driven to madness by his all-consuming need to possess the Dark Soul, serve as tragic parallels to the Jungian concept of the shadow overtaking the creative process. As Carl Jung once said, "A creative person has little power over his own life. He is not free. He is captive and driven by his daimon".

In these instances, the Dark Souls series presents a complex exploration of the human condition, where the light and dark are not merely opposites, but inextricably bound together. The painted worlds of Ariamis and Ariandel serve as haunting, yet beautiful reflections of our own struggles to accept and integrate the full breadth of our emotions and desires - the shadow aspects that we so often try to repress or deny. (Not mentioning the can of lorebrain worms that is Hollow Knight in this log.)

## The Madness of Repression: Goya's Black Paintings

Perhaps no artist has captured the consequences of a repressed shadow more vividly than Francisco Goya in his series of "Black Paintings." Created late in life, when Goya was dealing with illness and disillusionment, these works are a descent into the artist's personal hell – a manifestation of his darkest thoughts and fears.

Take "Saturn Devouring His Son," arguably the most famous of the series. In this grotesque depiction of the Roman god consuming his own child, we see the destructive power of the shadow when it's left to run amok. It's a chilling reminder of what Jung meant when he said, "Everyone carries a shadow, and the less it is embodied in the individual's conscious life, the blacker and denser it is."

Goya's Black Paintings serve as a stark warning: repress your shadow at your own peril. But they also demonstrate the cathartic power of art – by externalizing his inner demons, Goya created works of staggering emotional impact that continue to resonate with viewers centuries later.

## The Butterfly Effect: Everything is Connected

As we delve deeper into the shadow realm of creativity, we begin to see connections everywhere. Like the butterfly effect in chaos theory, where a small change can have far-reaching consequences, our creative expressions ripple outward, influencing the world in ways we may never fully comprehend.

In "Elden Ring," this interconnectedness is woven into the very fabric of the game world. The actions of demigods echo through the ages, shaping the land and its inhabitants. Similarly, in our own creative endeavors, we draw upon a vast web of influences – every book we've read, every song we've heard, every experience we've had – to create something new.

As William Faulkner, who also inspired G.R.R. Martin, famously said, "The human heart in conflict with itself is the only thing worth writing about". Where all this talk of magic, rings and gods are merely set dressing for what is the macrocosm of the human condition. This internal conflict, this dance between our conscious and unconscious selves, is the wellspring from which all great art flows.

## Parenthood: Facing the Inherited Shadow

But what happens when we're confronted with the shadow not just in ourselves, but in our children? Parenthood brings with it a unique terror: the fear of seeing our own worst traits manifested in the next generation.

In "Elden Ring," we see this play out in tragic fashion with characters like Mohg and Miquella, children born with curses that reflect the sins of their parents. It's a stark reminder that our shadow doesn't just affect us – it can cast a long darkness over those we love most.

Yet, even in this, there's potential for growth and redemption. By facing our shadow selves head-on, by integrating rather than repressing our darker aspects, we can break the cycle of inherited trauma. We can teach our children not to fear the shadow, but to dance with it, to harness its energy for creative and constructive purposes.

## The Gold in the Shadow: Finding Light in Darkness

As we near the end of our exploration, let's return to the image of the Erdtree in "Elden Ring." This massive, golden tree that dominates the landscape is both a source of life and a symbol of stagnation. Its roots reach deep into the earth, drawing upon the very shadows it seems to banish.

This imagery perfectly encapsulates the Jungian concept of finding the gold in the shadow. Our darkest aspects, when confronted and integrated, can become our greatest strengths. The anger that once consumed us can fuel our passion for justice. The fear that paralyzed us can sharpen our instincts and drive us to grow.

In the words of Carl Jung himself, "One does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light, but by making the darkness conscious." This is the essence of the creative process – diving into the depths of our psyche, confronting the monsters that lurk there, and emerging with pearls of wisdom and beauty.

## Epilogue: The Eternal Dance

As we conclude our journey through the shadowlands of creativity, let us remember that this dance never truly ends. Like the cycles of day and night, like the waxing and waning of the moon, we are in a constant state of flux between our light and dark aspects.

The artist's task – indeed, the task of every human being – is to keep this dance going. To neither repress the shadow nor let it run wild, but to engage with it in a continuous dialogue of creation and transformation.

In doing so, we not only enrich our own lives but contribute to the grand tapestry of human culture. Every stroke of the painter's brush, every note of the musician's song, every word of the writer's tale is a step in this cosmic dance, a reflection of the eternal interplay between light and shadow.

So let us embrace our shadows, pour our hearts and souls into our creations, and remember that in the end, as Jacob Geller so eloquently puts it in his video essays, art is the closest thing we have to magic in this world. It's our way of leaving a mark, of saying "I was here, I felt this, I lived."

And in that act of creation, in that dance with our shadows, we find not just self-expression, but self-transcendence. We become, for a brief moment, something more than ourselves – we become the very essence of what it means to be human, in all its glorious complexity.
